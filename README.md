# Hello, World! 👋

I'm Yara Allam, a sophomore at the Faculty of Computer and Data Science at Alexandria University. My concentration is in Intelligent Systems and I have a deep love for Machine Learning and Data Science. I'm also interested in web development, though as a means to display my ideas to the world.

## 🧠 Interests

I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology and biology, particularly in neuroscience, and bioinformatics as a whole! I believe that understanding our own biological systems can lead to significant advancements in technology and vice versa.

## ♟️ Chess

I'm pretty decent if I say so myself. It's a game that combines strategy, foresight, and adaptability, much like computational intelligence! Feel free to hit me up for a challenge!

## 📚 Current Projects

Something's definitely cooking, folks. Look in the section above for a small hint? 👀
